        <h2>HOW TO MAKE THIS SALAD:</h2>
        <p>To make this sesame Asian slaw recipe, simply…</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Make your dressing.</b> Whisk all of the ingredients together in a small bowl until combined. Or — my preferred method — just add them to a mason jar and shake-shake-shake until the dressing is ready to go. Taste and add in extra maple syrup or honey if you would like a sweeter dressing.</li>
            <li><b>Mix the salad.</b> Then combine all of your salad ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle evenly with the dressing and toss until combined.</li>
            <li><b>Serve!</b> And serve the sesame slaw right away while it’s nice and fresh!</li>
        </ol>
