        <h2>EVERYDAY ASIAN SALAD INGREDIENTS:</h2>
        <p>To make this easy Asian salad recipe, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Slaw / Greens:</b> I typically use a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw for this recipe (green or red cabbage, or a mix). Or if you’re living somewhere (like me!) where bagged coleslaw isn’t available, you can just chop up a bunch of cabbage and make your own. ♡</li>
            <li><b>Shredded Carrots:</b> Most bagged coleslaws also contain shredded carrots, but I like to add in more for that extra sweet and crunchy goodness.</li>
            <li><b>Veggies:</b> I just chopped up a yellow bell pepper for this slaw. But avocado would also be awesome, or there are all sorts of other crunchy slaw veggies that you’re welcome to add in too (see ideas below).</li>
            <li><b>Cilantro:</b> A handful of fresh cilantro really brightens this salad up. (Also, if you happen to have some fresh mint on hand, add that in too!)</li>
            <li><b>Onions:</b> I used thinly-sliced green onions for this slaw. But thinly-sliced red onions would work too.</li>
            <li><b>Almonds:</b> Sliced or slivered, and preferably toasted a bit to bring out their flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Sesame seeds:</b> I also love sprinkling on some sesame seeds (white or black) at the end for added crunch and flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Sesame vinaigrette:</b> Made with oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup (or honey), toasted sesame oil, ground ginger, garlic, S&P.</li>
        </ul>
      
    </div>
